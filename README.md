# RPN-challenge


## Description
This project is an implementation of a Reverse Polish Notation calculator. Reverse Polish Notation is a mathematical equation that is expressed by the operator following the operand. Instead of 2 + 5, like we're used to seeing, the statement becomes 2 5 + with RPN. This Ruby method allows for RPN input and outputs correct answers.

## Tech Emphasis
This is my first Ruby project and I experimented with standard input/standard output and class structures.

## SetUp
- Run `git clone https://github.com/TaylorNoelJordan/RPN-challenge.git` in your terminal.
- CD into the directory.
- Run `ruby rpn-challenge.rb`
- Press `q` to quit the application

## Instructions
To run the RPN calculator, input your operands followed by the operator. This particular application can operate addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
- Follow setup instructions
- Input up to four numeric values followed by one of the following: `+, -, *, /`
- Press enter for calculation
- Press `q` to quit.

## Note
This project is a work in progress and these instructions outline how the application __should__ run, not how it is running currently. There are currently some bugs that I'll be receiving feedback on and updating once I've received new information. If you take a look at my code and have any insights, please feel free to share. Thank you!
